# doilink for OAPDF project
use DOI for linking to pdf page

- Install requests module in Python:  
	`pip install requests`
- Copy the **gendoipage.py** to a repository containing PDF files
- `python gendoipage.py` to generate pages for doi link page
- Copy the pages directories to this repository.

The big pdf database has been blocked by Github again...

I have to think out a method to save the PDF file ....  

It's unreliable in Github...
